## Introduction

The https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3 repo contains inference and training code for YOLOv3 in PyTorch. The code works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Training is done on the COCO dataset by default: https://cocodataset.org/#home. **Credit to Joseph Redmon for YOLO:** https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/.


## Requirements

Python 3.7 or later with all `requirements.txt` dependencies installed, including `torch >= 1.5`. To install run:
```bash
$ pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
